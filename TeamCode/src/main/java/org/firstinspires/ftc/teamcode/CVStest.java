/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use a video source (camera) as a color sensor
 *
 * A "color sensor" will typically determine the color of the object that it is pointed at.
 *
 * This sample performs the same function, except it uses a video camera to inspect an object or scene.
 * The user may choose to inspect all, or just a Region of Interest (ROI), of the active camera view.
 * The user must also provide a list of "acceptable colors" (Swatches) from which the closest matching
 * color will be selected.
 *
 * To perform this function, a VisionPortal runs a PredominantColorProcessor process.
 *   The PredominantColorProcessor (PCP) process is created first, and then the VisionPortal is built.
 *   The (PCP) analyses the ROI and splits the colored pixels into several color-clusters.
 *   The largest of these clusters is then considered to be the "Predominant Color"
 *   The process then matches the Predominant Color with the closest Swatch and returns that match.
 *
 * To aid the user, a colored rectangle is drawn on the camera preview to show the RegionOfInterest,
 * The Predominant Color is used to paint the rectangle border, so the user can visualize the color.
 *
 * Tip:  Connect an HDMI monitor to the Control Hub to view the Color Sensor process in real-time.
 *       Or use a screen copy utility like ScrCpy.exe to view the video remotely.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
